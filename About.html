            <p2>

                SewerSlvt (aka. as Jvne, previously Jvnko) is an Australian based music producer. They specialise in electronic music,
                specifically the breakcore genre with darker themes. Their first album 'Drowning in the sewer' was released in July of 2019
                containing 9 songs. Throughout Jvne's works many references can be spotted such as notable anime characters on album covers, however,
                one of the most noteable references being their 'Cyberia Lyr1+2=3' album. The cover and name of the album and songs are a reference
                to the anime 'Serial Experiments Lain', Cyberia being one of the locations in the anime. In addition, the songs also contain voice
                samples from some of the episodes.

                Jvne's latest album, which is also their last, 'we had good times together don't forget
                that' was produced in memory of Jvne's late partner Angel who they lost due to suicide. On the last song of the youtube album titled 'goodbye' the music displays
                a series of google street-view locations which were of importance to the couple, such as where their first date was. At the end of the
                album we see a visual: 'Dedicated to the memory of Angel'.
                As of now Jvne no longer has an internet presence and their discord, patreon and merch store have all closed down. Once the merch store 
                was sold out a large sum of the portions were donated to the Beyond Blue foundation, which aims to provice support for those struggling 
                with mental health. <br/>
                Jvne and her fans are large advocates for mental health and giving support to those who need it, below are resources for those who
                may be struggling or wish to donate:
